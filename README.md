This is a small project, which was needed for Job Interview.

Small App "Grid Clicker", which in this repo is purely written in Vanilla JavaScript.

Clone a repo in your terminal, then get into the folder. Next, just type `node server.js`, where app should run on custom hand written JavaScript server. Port 9000 by default. 
So get into your browser and type `localhost:9000`. 

Enjoy!
